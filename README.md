# Python --EDA-and-Data-Visualization

## OVERVIEW ##
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb bookings data using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib). The objective is to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in booking behavior, pricing, and location popularity. The notebook addresses key business questions through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insightful visualizations. Findings support better decision-making for hosts and platform strategy.

## OBJECTIVES ##
• Analyze the distribution of booking types, property types, and locations 
• Identify pricing patterns across different cities, seasons, and property types
• List and analyze bookings based on availability, review scores, and host activities
• Explore and categorize listings using specific criteria such as minimum nights, room type, and cancellation policy

## FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ##
• Property Distribution: The dataset features a wide range of property types and room types, with entire homes being the most preferred by users.
• Pricing Insights: Analysis of pricing trends reveals significant variation across cities and property types, with higher prices in central and tourist-heavy areas.
• Geographical Trends: Top cities like New York and London dominate in listing volume, while availability and review scores vary notably by region.
